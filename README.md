To run the project, make sure you initially have internet on your phone.

Running the app a few times should show three difference screens:

1. Fetched some products - shows all the products
2. Fetched no products - shows a message that there were 0 products
3. Failed to fetch products - api call failed so a message is shown explaining that

Once the product list has been shown at least once, Room should have populated a database.
Now turn off the phone's internet/data, kill the app, and relaunch the app.

Since there is no internet access, logging into the app should fetch a stored product list from the database
